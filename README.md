# ThunderpigsRL

The main intend to create this RL was to improve my python skills while having fun.

It is based on the python rougelike-tutorial found on https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

Requirements:
=============

python >= 3.6 (developed and tested on python3.11
tcod >= 11.13
numpy >= 1.18

you can install tcod or numpy via pip or pip3

start the game by entering:
python main.py (or python3.XX main py)

Settings:
=========

You can change the language between EN and DE in settings.py

Gameplay:
=========

To be honest it is not the funniest game availible but it might improve over time. During gameplay you can always
press "h" and get a list of availible keys. Keep in mind that there might be hidden doors which you must search by
pressing "m" several times. This will search all tiles inside your FOV for hidden stuff.

Others:
=======

Feel free to have a look at the code and use it, parts of it or just give me some feedback what could be improved from
your point of view.

Thanks and all the best,

Thunderpig
